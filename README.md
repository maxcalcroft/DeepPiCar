# DeepPiCar
Following and expanding upon David Tian's work with a Freenove Raspberry Pi Car

This project uses the Freenove 3-wheeled Smart Car Kit for Raspberry Pi and a Coral Edge TPU from Google to create a small scale autonomous vehicle capable of deep learning  using computer vision algorithms to identify road markings and road signs/pedestrians etc.

Further expansions to the work include basic script along with a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for object detection and avoidance. This will then be adapted to be used for a low cost LiDAR so that SLAM an path planning can be implemented using ROS.
